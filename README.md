### Hi there 👋

It seems as you stumbled across my profile. 👍 🙂<br>
If you have some time, why not look around a bit?

I can recommend you to view [this project](https://github.com/einfachIrgendwer0815/WerwolfOnline) of mine. It's a popular parlour game implemented for browser with online multiplayer!
<br><br>
Another project I'm currently working on is [sqlIntuitive](https://github.com/einfachIrgendwer0815/sqlIntuitive). SqlIntuitive is a python library created to make database stuff easier to handle and to make you no longer get in trouble implementing sql statements 😀. You should definitely have a look.
